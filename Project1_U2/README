Hello TA!

To run the program, please import the project into Eclipse, and run the main 
method in Driver.java. There are basic documentation in the form of comments
in each class.

The testing program is Test.java. It tests the self-healing exception handli
ng code. When exception occurs, it will ask for a new input from stdin.

The Class Diagram is diagram.jpg. The input file is "input" and "input2". The
re is also an ill-formated input file named "input_error1" for testing.

The log file is "Log"

Thanks!
