Hello TA!

To run the program, please import the project into Eclipse, and run the project
 in a web server (I used Tomcat v8). There are basic documentation in the form 
 of comments in each class.

The workflow is as follows: After the browser visits http://localhost:8080/Proj
ect1_U5/, it will be redirected to Project1_U5/ModelServlet according to web.xm
l. ModelServlet will generate the content of that webpage, where the user need 
to pick a selection. Then the form will be posted to Project1_U5/ConfigServlet.
Finally, after the user make the choice, the form will be posted to Project1_U5
/ShowResult.jsp which is in the WEB-INF folder. The program read parameters, ge
t the corresponding model from the LinkedHashMap 

The Class Diagram is diagram.jpg. The input file is "input" and "input2". They 
are both in the WEB-INF folder. There are also some screen shots in the screensh
ot folder

Thanks!
