Hello TA!

For grading convenience, in this project I merged the client and server pack
age into a single package called network. The driver program for both server
 and client are all in the driver package.

To run the program, please import the project into Eclipse, and run the main 
method in Driver.java. There are basic documentation in the form of comments
in each class.

The Class Diagram is diagram.jpg. The input file is "input" and "input2". 

Thanks!
