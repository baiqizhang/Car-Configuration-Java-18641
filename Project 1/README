Hello TA!

To run the program, please import the project into Eclipse, and run the main 
method in Driver.java. There are basic documentation in the form of comments
in each class.

The testing mechanism is enabled by JUnit. To run the test, please add JUnit
to the build path, then run TestClass.java as JUnit Test.

The Class Diagram is diagram.jpg. The input file is "input".

Thanks!
