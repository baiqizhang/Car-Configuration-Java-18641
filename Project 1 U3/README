Hello TA!

Sorry for the late submission! I was attending the TOC from SV campus. I tri
ed to finish the assignment on time but in turn still a few hours late.

To run the program, please import the project into Eclipse, and run the main 
method in Driver.java. There are basic documentation in the form of comments
in each class.

I decide to put syncronized method in Automotive class because mutual exclus
ion is only required for methods of a certain Automotive instance. It is acc
eptable for two edit method for two different Automotive instance interleave
s. 

The testing program is Test.java. It tests the self-healing exception handli
ng code. When exception occurs, it will ask for a new input from stdin.

The Class Diagram is diagram.jpg. The input file is "input". 

Thanks!
